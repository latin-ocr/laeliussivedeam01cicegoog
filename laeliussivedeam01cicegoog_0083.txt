DIALOGUE ΟΝ FRIEND SHIP. 81

iany indicatione what she wishes, requires and
esium, we nevertheless somehow or other become
heaf to her voice, and do not attend to those things
which we are warned against by her. For the inter-
ourse of Friendship is varied and manifold‚ and many
auses of suspicion and offence are given, which it is
he duby of a wise man at one time to avoid, at another

employed, first that warning may be free from bitter-

truth, so that he refuses to hear what is true from a
friend, his safety must be despaired of. For that is a
wise sayinq of (late, as many others of his dre, “ that
