undergo some trouble on account of it? For what is
the difference, if the emotions of the soul are taken
away, I say not between a 11100 0οᾶ 0 1100315, 111115 between
1, man and a rock, or a trunk of a trec, or anything of
bhe same sort Ρ For those are not to be listened to who
desire a kind of virtue that is hard and, as it were,
steeled, which is indeed, both in many things, and
