devoted themselves to the State, and those who are de-

l· 1ghted with the knowledge 61 things and with learning,
and those who leisurely carry on their own business3

lastly, those who have given themselves up entirely to
pleasures, —that without Friendship 1116 16 nothing, at
least, if they wish to live 111 any degree with propriety.
For 'Friendship‚ somehow or other, creeps through the
lives 61 611, and permits not any mode 61 spending 1116
to be free f'rom itself. Nay more, 11 any one is 61 611611

Thus Nature loves nothing solitary, and always strives
after something as a support; and this is sweetest in
the case of the closest friend.
