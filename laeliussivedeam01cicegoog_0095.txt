DIALOG-UE ΟΝ FRIEND SHIP. 93

*there was reposo ful] of enjoyment. Ι never offended
him in even the least thing, so far, indeed, as Ι have been
aware. I heard from himself nothing which Ι should
be unwilling to hear. We had one home, one table,
and that in common3 and not only our military service,
but also our travels and country walks were taken in
company. For what shall I say of our occupatione in
always investigating and learning something, in which,
removed from the eyes of tho people‚ we spent all our
leisure time i> And if the recollection and memony of
these things had died together with him, Ι should have
been able by no means to endure the loss of that most
intimate friend and affectionate man. But neither are
they extinct3 they arer ather cherished and increased
by reflection and memory; and, if Ι had been quite de-
prived of them, old age itself would nevertheless bring
me great. consolation3 for Ι cannot live long in such
bereavement. But all things of short duration ought
to be bearable, even though they be great. This is
what Ι had to say about Friendship. But Ι exhort
you so to regard Virtus, without which Friendship
cannot exist, that, with the exception of Virtue, you
may think nothing preferable to Friendship.
