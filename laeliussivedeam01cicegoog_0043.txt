DIALOGUE ΟΝ FRIEND SHIP. 41

But if we resolve that it is right, either to grant to our
friends whatever they may wish, or to obtain from them
whatever we may wish, we should indeed be men of
perfect wisdom if the thing has no mischief in it. But
we are speaking about those friends, who are before our

eyes, whom we have seen, or concerm'ng whom we have
received tradition, whom common life is acquainted
with. From this number we must take our exampleS,
