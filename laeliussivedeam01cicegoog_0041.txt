DIALOGUE ΟΝ FRIENDSHIP. 39 “

Ε’11611ᾶ8111Ρ8 wont to be extinguished, but also lasting
hatreds to be engendered. So many of these things,
like fatalities, threaten Friendships, that he used to say,
that to escape them all seemed to him to be an indication,
unt only of wisdom, but also of good fortune.

XI. -Therefore, let 118 first see this, if you Ρ16886,
how far affection ought to go in Friendship. If Corio·
lanus 11811 friends, ought they to have borne arms against
th, eir native country with Coriolanus? quht his friends

other contemporaries, who were his friends, But Caius
Β10881118, of Cumae, the friend of your family, Scaevola,
when he came to me, when Ι was assisting the consuls
Laenas and Rupilius in their deliberations, 150 8116 for ·
pardon, brought forward this plea that I should pardon
him—that he esteemed Tiberius Gracchus 80 highly, that
he thought he ought to do whatever he wished. Then
said I,‘ ‘What. ¹ even if he wished you to set fire to 15116
Capitol ?’' “Neverss' he saJS, “ would he have wished
that indeedss’ “But if he had wished it ? ’' “ Ι should
have obeyedf’ You 866 what an impious sentiment.
And, by Η61611168, 116 did s0‚ or even more than he said,
for he did 11015 follow 15116 1881111688 of Tiberius Gracchus,
but guided it. And he showed himself not the com-
panion of his 11181111688, but its leader 3 and, consequently,
through 151118 1111815118151011, terrified by a fresh trial, he
fied 111150 Α818 Minor, betook himself to our 6116111168, and
paid heavy and deserved penalties to the state. It is
therefore no excuse for 8 crime if you sin for the sake
of 8 friend. For since an opinion 88 to yowr friend's
virtue was the cause of the friendship, it is difficult for

the friendship to romain, if you decline from virtue. ·
