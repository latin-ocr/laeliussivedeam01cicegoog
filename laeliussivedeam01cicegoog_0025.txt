’ DIALOGUE ON' FRIENDSHIP. 23

but the greater as each approached nearest to another.
Consequently, follow-citizens are preferable to foreign-
erS, relations 'to strangers3 for with these Nature her· ,,
self has, created 'Friendship, but it has not sufficient
stability. For Friendship surpasses Relationship in
this, that from Relationship kind feeling can be re-
moved; from Friendship it cannot: for when good
feeling has been taken away, the name of Friendship
is taken away, but that of Relationship remaius, How
great, however, the power of Friendship is, can most
fully be understood from this, that startinq from the
boundless followship of the human racc, which Nature
herself has cemented, it is a thing 80· contracted and
reduced to a narrow ranye, that-all affection is a union
between two or between a few.

VL—Now Friendship is nothing· else than perfect
agreement 011 all divine and human things, together
with kindness and affection3 and, wisdom indeed being
excepted, probably not any better qist than this has
been given by the immortal gods to man. Some prefer
riches, some good health, some power, some honours3
many even prefer bodizy pleasures. This last, indeed, is
characteristic of beasts, but those former ones are perish-

able and uncertain, dependent not so much upon our ·

plans as on the fickleness of fortune. Those, however,
who place the greatest good in virtue, teach admirably
indeed ; but this very virtue both produces and up-
holds Friendship: nor can Friendship by anymeans exist
without virtue. Now let us explain virtue from the
ordinary customof life and of our speech, and not, as cer-
tain philosophers dc, measure it out with pomposity of
language‚ and let us reckon as good men those who are
considered such—the Paulli, the (latos, the Galli, the
Scipios and the Philos. Ordinary life is contented with
these. But let us omit those who are nowhere at all found.
