DIALOGUE ΟΝ FRIENDSHIP. 31

 

 

For Love, from which Friendship has derived its name,
is the principal meam for cementing good feeling. For
advantages are indeed often derived even from those
who are courted and respected‚ under the pretence of
Friendship, for the sake of a temporary purpose.
In Friendship‚ however, nothing is unreal‚ nothing
simulated, and whatever feeling] exists, it is real and
sincere. And therefore, Friendship seems· to me to
have sprung rather from Nature than from indigenae,
from an inclination of the mind, accompanied by a cer-
tain sense of affection, rather than from the calcula-
tion how much advantage it would involve. Of what
kind indeed this is can be observed even in certain
beastS, which so love their young up to a certain time,
and are so loved by them, that their affection is easily
apparent. And this is much more evident in the case
of man; firstly from that affection which existe between
children and their parents, and which cannot be de·
stroyed except by abominable wickedness3 and then,
when a similar feeling of affection has arisen, if we
have met with any one with whose character and dis-
position we agree, because we seem to observe in him,
as it were,'a certain brilliancy of uprightness and virtue.
For nothing is more loveable than virtue3 there is no·
thing which more entices to love; inasmuch ae, on
account of their virtue and uprightneSS‚ we love, in a
certain manner, even those whom we have never seen.
Who is there who does not cherish with some affection
and kind feeling, the memory of Caius Fabricius and
Manius Curius whom he has never seen i> Who, more-
over‚ is there that does not hate Tarquin the Proud, who
that does not hate Sp. Cassius and Sp. Moelius Ρ There
was a struggle for empire in Italy with two leaderS, Pyr-
rhus and Hannibal3 from the one, on account of his
uprightneSS, we have minds not very much estranged 3
