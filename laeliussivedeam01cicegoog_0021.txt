vith whom both home and military service were shared,

vvisdom which Fannius has just now mentioned does
iot so much 1161131115 1116, especially as it is undeserved,
156 1511615 Ι hope the memory of our Friendship will 116

aecause, out of all the 6366, scarcely three ο1 four pairs
2f friends 616 mentioned, in which class I seem to hope
5116 friendship of Scipio and Laelius will be known to

FANNIUS. Τ11615 indeed, Laelius, must be sc. But,
3ince you have made mention of Friendship, and we
116 at leisure, γοα will do me 6 great favour (Ι hope

bo other matters, when they are asked of γοα, 66 γοα
will discourse concerning Friendship, what you think,
11 what kind γοα conceive it to be, what rules with reqard
ἑο it ou ‘ve.

chvolgl It will indeed bc very 6316661116 to 1116,
and that very request, when Ι was essaying to plead
with γοα, Fannius anticipated3 therefore you will do
what is very agreeable to 66611 of 116. ,

very glorious, 61111 we 616, 66 Fannius has said, 615
1616α16. But who 6111 Ι ⁴? 61 what ability 16 1511616 111
116 P It is 6 custom of the learned, 61111 that too of
15116 Greeks, that a subject be assigned them, concern-
'mg which they may disputo, however unpremeditatedly.
