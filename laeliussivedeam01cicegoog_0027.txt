DIALOGUE ΟΝ FRIE'NDSHIP. 25

 

Among such men, therefore, Friendship has so great
zdvantages as I can scarcely speak of. In the first
place, how can there be “a life worth living‚’' as
Ennius says, which does not reposo 111 the reciprocal
:goodwill of a friend Ρ What can be pleasanter than
bo have one with whom you can venture to converse
about all thinys as you would with yourself Ρ What
very great advantage would there be in prosperity,
unless you had a friend who should rej0ice in it as
well as yourself P It would indeed be hard to endure
adversity without one who would bear it with more
grief than yourself. Lastly, other things which are
desired are adapted‚ almost each to its own special
purposes; riches, that you may spend them,- power,
that you may be respected; honours, that you may be
praised3 pleasure8‚ that you may rejoice3 health, that
you may be free from pain and perform the duties of
the body. Friendship embraces many things! where·
ever thou turnest thyself she is at hand 3 from no place
is she excluded3 never is she out of season, never
troublesome. And consequently‚ as the proverb rum,
we do not make use of fire and water on more occasions
than Friendship. And I am not now speaking of the
common or ordinary kind os Friendship, which however,
itself is both pleasant and 111-0111811111, but of true and
perfect Friendship, such as was theirs a few of whom
are mentioned. For Friendship makes both prosperity
brighter and adversity lighter, by sharing and com-
municating them.

VH. —And while Friendship comprises very many
and very great advantageS, it certamly also stands be-
fore all other thinqs 111 this, that it shows forth a good
hope for the future, and does not suffer the spirits
either to be crushed or sink. For he who looks upon a
true friend, beholds‚ as it were. a reflection of himself.
