DIALOGUE ΟΝ FRIENDSHIP. 45

sent into exile, did not endure the injustice of hia un·-
grateful country,'which he ought to have endured. He
did the same thinq, which twenty years previously
Coriolanus had done among us. No one was found as a.

helper to these men against their country, and so each ·

(gf them committed suicide. Therefore‚ such an agree-
ment of unprincipled men ought not only not to be
protected by the excuse of Friendship‚ but rather
visited with every punishment, that no one may think
it permitted him to follow even a friend when making
war on his country. But this, indeed, as matters begin
to tend, I rather think will some da‘y'happen. Το me,
however, it is not a less matter of anxiety, of what
character the state will become after my death, than
what it is to-day.

XIIL—Let this then be established as the first law
of Friendship‚ viz. that we seek honourable thinys from·
our friends3 and that we do honourable thinqs for the
sake of our friends; that we do not indeed delay until
we are asked3 that zeal be ever present, that hesitation
be absent3 but that we delight to give advice freely.
Especially in Friendship let the influence of friends who
give good advice, have weight, and let it both be em-
ployed for warning, not only openly, but also sharply,
if the occasion shall demand3 and let it be obeyed
when thus employed. For by some men, wh0‚ Ι hear,
have been considered wise in Greece, I think strange
viations have been approved: (but there is nothing
which they do not follow with their own subtlety,)
in part that too close friendships should be avoided,
that it be not necessary that one should be anxious
for many3 that each man has enough and more than
enouqh of his own affairs3 that to be too much mixed
up with other p'ersons' conseo-ns is troublesome3 that it is
most convenient to hold as loosely as possible the reins
